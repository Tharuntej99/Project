                    <p>Persephone, the goddess of spring, is the story’s heroine alongside the underworld. Initially portrayed as an innocent and naive young woman, her character develops dramatically as she faces more challenges.

                        Persephone is depicted with pink skin and a generous heart, a stark contrast to the harsh reality of Olympus. Her journey included discovering her strength, and she dealt with the trauma of being raped by Apollo, as well as her strong feelings about the underworld.</p>

                    <p>Zeus, the king of the gods, is depicted as a yellow-skinned man with long, straight hair. Known for his promiscuity and egotism, Zeus’ actions often brought chaos to Olympus. A member of the Six Realms of Lies, he has intimate relationships with many characters, including his brothers Hades and Poseidon, and many lovers. His character provides a lens through which to examine issues of power and corruption.</p>
